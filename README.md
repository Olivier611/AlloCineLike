REST PROJECT
In this project you have to propose a Web Application that provide de following REST services about Movies presentations and schedule on the different Parisian Movie Theatres. To have a better idea what we are expecting from you as a project, please visit AlloCiné web site. 
1)	The first service is provided to Movies Theatres so that they can post new movies and their schedule.  For this, you need to propose a web page to movies owners, with a login so that they can post movie’s details: Title, duration, Language (subtitles if needed), director, main actors, and min age required. To make it simple we suppose that a movie is proposed from a starting date to an end date, three days per week (and a given starting time for each movie session).  Of course you need to specify the city where the movie is displayed (the address of the Movie Theatre)
2)	A second service will be used to display all the movies proposed in a given city. This will be through a free access web page, no login is required
3)	Each Movie proposed as a response to the web service displaying the list of movies per a given city  is actually a web service that displays the details of the Movies (given in question 1)
For this project, you will need Java, Eclipse, JAX-RS, Jersey Jackson and Tomcat. You can either use a MySQL database or on memory database like HSQLDB to store the information about the movies. An object oriented collection initiated at the starting of the project execution is fine as well. 
The project is to be done by group of 2, max 3 students, no more. I will schedule with you a defense session so you will have a chance to defend your project. No PPT, no Doc, only a working code/project
